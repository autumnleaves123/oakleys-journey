My dog training journey with Oakley utilizing Errorless Learning, R+, and LIMA training principles.

## Problem Statement:
The most common pitfalls I have encountered when training Oakley include:
1. expecting a behavior before teaching it (unrealistic about current state),
2. moving too fast (lack of steps between current and future state),
3. lack of motivation and not recognizing progress (consistency),
4. setting too many goals and not being intentional with how it fits into our lifestyle,
5. and keeping both of us under threshold (which is needed to maintain patience and promote learning).

## Vision:
I want to create a solution that is objective and formulates a realistic, attainable, and personalized animal behavior modification plan when proper management and training is utilized. This solution will utilize a feedback loop (with inputs tracking distance, difficulty, and duration) to adjust the plan and determine progress.

## Background:
There are a few key terms and definitions I will explain as the background for this project:

**Operant Conditioning:** a method of learning that uses rewards and  punishment to modify behavior. These are the quadrants of operant conditioning:
- Positive Reinforcement (R+): contingently deliver a consequence to increase the probability that the desired behavior will occur.<br>
*Example: You give your a dog a treat when they sit on command.*

- Positive Punishment (P+): punishment by application, contingently deliver an aversive consequence to reduce the probability that the problem behavior will occur. <br>
*Example: You scold your dog when they have an accident in the house. You snap the leash when your dog pulls.*

- Negative Reinforcement (R-): punishment by removal, contingently withdraw an aversive antecedent stimulus to increase the probability that the right behavior will occur. <br>
*Example #1: To discourage your dog from barking at strangers from the window, you play a high-pitched frequency that is unpleasant to them until they stop barking, teaching them that if they stop barking, the unpleasant noise will go away.* <br>
*Example #2: You may inadvertently reinforce your dog saying hi to every stranger you encounter by relaxing leash pressure when they reach someone they're pulling towards. In this case, leash pressure is unpleasant and suffocating and they are rewarded when that pressure is removed.*

- Negative Punishment (P-): contingently withdraw a positive reinforcer to reduce the probability that the problem behavior will occur.<br>
*Example: Your dog is excited to greet guests and jumps on them, so the guest steps away or turns their back to the dog, therefore showing the dog that unwanted behavior will not be rewarded with attention or pets.*

- Extinction: Permanently remove the maintaining reinforcer to suppress the behavior or reduce it to baseline levels.<br>
*Example: If your dog begs at the dinner table and you ignore this behavior, eventually the dog will stop begging.*

**Conditioned Emotional Response (CER):** an automatic response to a stimulus that has been learned from past exposures and experiences <br>
*Example: If someone is afraid of heights, they're going to be scared to skydive and jump out of a plane even if they have a parachute*

**The Premack Principle:** states that highly desirable, more probable behaviors can be used to reinforce less desirable, less probable behaviors<br>
*Example: If your dog wants to chase a squirrel (probable behavior) and you want your dog to redirect towards you (less probable), you can put your dog on a long lead and give just enough slack to take off leash pressure while not keeping the squirrel out of reach. Then, you can teach the dog that once they listen to you and come when called, then you can chase the squirrel together.* 

**Errorless Learning:** This training philosophy by aims to minimize mistakes made by the learner, which will in turn decrease the likelihood that errors will be repeated during future trials. This philosophy displaces blame from the learner and assigns it to the teacher, stating that errors are:
- a function of poor analysis of behavior,
- a poorly designed shaping program,
- moving too fast from step to step in the program,
- and the lack of the prerequisite behavior necessary for success in the program.

**Force-Free Training:** teaching an animal without pain, intimidation, threats, force, or coercion

**Least Intrusive, Minimally Aversive (LIMA):** training philosophy that uses the least intrusive, minimally aversive strategy out of a set of humane and effective tactics likely to succeed in achieving a training or behavior change objective. Relying on punishment in training does not answer this question, and therefore offers no acceptable behavior for the animal to learn to replace the unwanted behavior.

**Balanced Training:** any approach to dog training or behavior modification which involves the use of both reward based techniques, and aversive consequences

**Dominance / Alpha Dog Training:** uses aversive training techniques such as “alpha rolls”, staring the dog down or other confrontational methods and punishment which can cause fear, pain and distress to dogs

## Questions for Success:
*Based on the L.E.G.S. (Learning, Environment, Genetics, Self) framework:*

1. **LEARNING.**

2. a. **ENVIRONMENT.** Has my dog's needs been met? This includes physical, mental, and natural canine behaviors (sniffing, chewing, shredding, digging, etc.)

2. b. **ENVIRONMENT.** Has my dog gotten enough rest? <br>
Adult dogs sleep 16-20 hours a day. Making sure your dog has the time and place to get high quality sleep will go a long way in their ability to handle stress and make good decisions.

2. c. **ENVIRONMENT.** Is my dog in the right emotional state for training?

3. **GENETICS.** What is my dog's genetic predisposition? <br>
Oakley is a type of Bulldog (Pitbull/Boxer mix), which is a genetic subgroup of guardian dogs (Mastiffs). This particular breed, aside from having the negative connotation of dog fighting, has been bred to be:
- strong, powerful, and fearless to fight and bring down bulls (hence the name),
- affectionate and good natured towards humans,
- impulsive (all or nothing) and overaroused in highly stimulating environments,
- protective and defensive,
- easygoing and adaptable to pet lifestyles outside of the contest environment

4. a. **SELF.** What are my dog's favorite activities and rewards?
- rolling in the grass
- thermal pleasure laying out in the sun
- squeaking a million times a minute
- cuddling on the couch
- using her brain through training games or puzzles

4. b. **SELF.** Does my dog have a chronic or acute health condition?

4. c. **SELF.** What is my dog's body language telling me?
